The Halo3 Game Master is an application for moderating what essentially amount to Halo parties with large numbers of people, handling the allocation of players to teams and the choosing of what map to play and what play type will be used.  It understands how to allocate players fairly, and includes network mirroring and includes an iPhone/mobile interface.  Game types and maps can be disabled and can have weights set, and maps have configurable player capacities so you don't end up with sixteen people shoulder-to-shoulder on the smallest map.  A user guide is included.
